## ONE-HOT function

The code you provided appears to be a Python function one_hot(Y) that takes an input array Y and returns a one-hot encoded version of Y. Here's a brief explanation of the function:

**np.zeros((Y.size, Y.max() + 1))**: This creates a matrix of zeros with dimensions (Y.size, Y.max() + 1), where Y.size is the number of elements in the input array Y, and Y.max() + 1 is the maximum value of Y incremented by 1. This creates a matrix with rows equal to the size of Y and columns equal to the maximum value of Y plus 1, which will be used to store the one-hot encoded values.

**one_hot_Y[np.arange(Y.size),Y] = 1**: This sets the values in the one_hot_Y matrix to 1 at the corresponding indices specified by Y. np.arange(Y.size) creates an array of indices from 0 to Y.size - 1, which is used to index the rows of one_hot_Y, and Y is used to index the columns of one_hot_Y. This sets the value at the (i, Y[i]) position of one_hot_Y to 1, where i is the index of the element in Y.

one_hot_Y = one_hot_Y.T: This transposes the one_hot_Y matrix, swapping the rows and columns. This is done to get the one-hot encoded matrix in the correct shape, where rows represent the one-hot encoded values for each element in Y.

Finally, the function returns the one-hot encoded matrix one_hot_Y.

Note: The code uses numpy (import numpy as np) which is a popular numerical computing library in Python.
